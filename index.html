    <p>With the current membership of about 150 elected women artists, Connecticut Women Artists (CWA) has supported and promoted women in the visual arts across the state for over 90 years.  This year, Roberta Shea from Newtown, has won first place for her oil painting, &ldquo;Down by the River.&rdquo;  Her painting depicts a scene in the early spring of the Pootutuck River where she frequently walks.</p>
    <p>During the pandemic, Roberta painted scenes close-to-home, recording nature, as an affirmation of the complexity, wonder, and resilience of nature.  Her painting of trees and flora show the &ldquo;the promise of spring and the enduring order that remains intact, regardless of our human fate.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The CWA 2021 Annual Members Juried Show is on view at the Art League of New Britain (ALNB) from April 17-May 14, 2021. To find more information about the exhibit and CWA, please visit their website at <a href="https://ctwomenartists.org">ctwomenartists.org</a>.</p>
