    <h1>Press Release</h1>
    <hr style="width: 50%">
    <p>Upcoming in February 2022, the <a href="https://rgoa.org">Ridgefield Guild of Artists</a> is pleased to bring back a small group show.  Five artists, as selected by a juror, will share the entire downstairs gallery.  Two artists will go in the front gallery, one in the middle and two in the third, thus the 2-1-2 title of the exhibition. The show was curated by Georgette Gouveia. Editor in Chief, WAG Magazine, an award winning luxury lifestyles publication of the Westchester and Fairfield County.</p>
    <p>One of the artists in the exhibition is Newtown artist Roberta Shea.  Atmosphere and luminance color are the key aspects of Shea&rsquo;s paintings. With bold, broad brushstrokes she creates a sense of place with paintings full of light, air, atmosphere, and mystery. Through observation she unveils many ways to see the landscape.  &ldquo;What is most important to me, says Shea, is letting the paint be the protagonist to direct the narrative.  I paint because I love paint, the feel of it when the brush meets the canvas and the colors.  Playing with color still gives me a thrill when one color is placed next to another and it sings.&rdquo; Seasonal change occurring in nature becomes my inspiration.  Because my landscapes are often an exploration of place, I cannot ignore the weather-causing changes happening around me.</p>
    <p>The public is invited to an opening reception on Saturday, February 12, 2022, from 4 - 6 pm, 34 Halpin Lane, Ridgefield, CT from 4 - 6pm.  The exhibit will run at the Guild from February 12 and close February 27, 2022.</p>
